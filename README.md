# BionicKeyboards

Open source production ready keyboards. This includes design files for the main PCB (schematic and layout), daughterboard (schematic and layout), case (design files more CNC machining) and firmware if forking e.g. QMK or ZMK was necessary.

You will also find a list of used parts and their datasheets and a list of manufacturers to get you started. 
For example, manufacturers for PCBs usually offer assmebly too.
I will also provide a list of expenses to give a raw idea about the production costs.
