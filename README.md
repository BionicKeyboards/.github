# BionicKeyboards

Open source production ready keyboards free for everyone. 
Each keyboard project includes all necessary components to go directly into production: 
- Design files for the main PCB (schematic and layout)
- Daughterboard (schematic and layout)
- Case (design files more CNC machining)
- Plate design files
- Firmware, if forking e.g. QMK or ZMK was necessary to provide special features.

Every component is optional. For example, you can always provide your own firmware.
Each keyboard provides an assembly guide and a prebuild kit so that you don't have to worry about picking materials etc.
Beacuse the keyboards are design as rapid disassembly keyboards their assembly only takes minutes and does not require any tools.

You will also find a list of used parts and their datasheets and a list of manufacturers to help you to get started. 

These projects don't require any technical knowledge and skills (e.g. soldering) or equipment.
Manufacturers for PCBs usually offer PCB assmebly too so that you get a finished PCB.
All you have to do is to find a manufacturer and then assemble the plug-play designed keyboard.
I will also provide a list of expenses for each model to give a raw idea about the production costs.

## Currently available projects
- [__Bionic75__]() - a 75% ultra-low latency wireless ultra-low power RGB keyboard with magnetic daughterboard connector and ESD protection that supports ZMK and QMK
